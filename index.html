      <h2>Hello,</h2>
      <p class='intro'>my name is Thomas Trippany.  I am an engineer by trade, but also the
          owner and founder of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/CrossFitEvoke/">CrossFit Evoke.</a>  Currently, I am working as a Dynamics engineer
          for a large environmental testing company.  I am also working on my post graduate degree
          in lean management as well as my Six Sigma Green and Black Belts.  My short term goal is
          to  transition in project management and eventually upper level management.</p>

        <h3>Engineering</h3>
        <p>While I started my engineering career as more of an electrical engineer, I've recently starting working in dynamics, which is more of a mechanical engineering role.
            I also dabble in software development (C/C++/C# and most recently Python and a little HTML)</p>

        <h3>Personal Training</h3>
        <p>For most of my adult life, I've been involved in fitness training and even owned my own strength and conditioning gym for around 9 years.</p>
